      with BUS error on sparc.
    * Fix progress bar warning when removing files while loading thumbnails.
    * Fix image count in full screen information overlay when in slideshow.
    * Fix memory leak when unable to start a slideshow.

  Notes:

    For translation status list, see further below.

    Version in perenthesis indicates first appearance of feature or change.

    (2.1.5) Add support for color profiles when lcms is installed. To
    disable color profiles and use of lcms, run configure
    with '--without-lcms'.

    (2.1.1) Add support for viewing jpeg images and EXIF embedded within
    raw files for Canon (.crw, .cr2) Fujifilm (.raf), and Nikon (.nef).
    Note that not all cameras that support a raw format will necessarily
    save a usable jpeg in the raw file (for example some Nikon cameras only
    store a tiny thumbnail within the raw .nef file).

    (1.5.6) The "shared thumbnail cache" is a proposal to unify the method
    of storing thumbnails, so that they are compatible between different
    applications. Using this option will allow GQview to share it's
    thumbnails with, and use thumbnails from, other applications. Current
    releases of GNOME (through nautilus and gthumb) and the gimp use this
    new thumbnailing system. The latest draft of the thumbnail standard
    is located on freedesktop.org in the standards section, and links to:

      http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html

    The shared thumbnail standard and GQview's classic mechanism can
    not be used at the same time, enabling the "use shared thumbnail cache"
    option will disable the use of classic thumbnails and use the new
    shared thumbnails.

    (1.5.6) Collections contained in $HOME/.gqview/collections are now
    updated when moving or renaming files, even if the collection is not
    open at the time.

    (1.5.6) The new option to the keep the full screen window above other
    windows is only available when using at least GTK+ 2.4.0

    (1.5.5) Dialog buttons are now ordered as recommended by the GNOME HIG.
    The GNOME Human Interface Guidelines live at:
       http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/
    To restore the old button order you must be using GTK 2.6 and set
    the "gtk-alternative-button-order" key to TRUE in the gtkrc file:
       $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0
    by changing or adding this line:
       gtk-alternative-button-order = 1

    (1.5.5) The dithering option is now a hidden option, to change it
    please refer to section 10.7 of the manual (help -> contents).

    (1.5.0) Keywords and comments can now be entered for a file. Two places
    allow keyword and comment entry. The first is via the new image details
    sidebar accessed with (Ctrl-K), and the second is a details tab in the
    properties dialog. If multiple files are selected, two buttons are
    available: One allows adding the keywords to the selected files, the
    other replaces existing keywords with the new keywords.

    Keyword and comment metadata is stored in $(HOME)/.gqview/metadata, and
    mirrors the existing filesystem tree. Metadata filenames have a suffix
    of .meta appended. If 'cache into .thumbnails' is enabled, metadata is
    stored locally to the original file in a hidden subfolder ".metadata".
    If write permissions do not allow local saving of metadata, GQview falls
    back to the default $(HOME)/.gqview/metadata location.

    (1.5.0) Search dialog (F3 key) types:
       Path       searches files in the entered folder.
       Comments   searches all file metadata stored in ~/.gqview/metadata.
       Results    searches the current list of results, allowing refinement.

    (1.3.6) Drag and drop has been significantly improved, with a few
    changes. Button 1 will now initiate a drag, button 2 will still work
    for this, the difference is button 2 will not change the selection.

    (1.3.6) A middle button click will now toggle selection of clicked item.

    (1.3.5) UTF-8 and filenames: GQview works fine if your filenames
    correctly match the prefered locale encoding (LANG environment
    variable), and prints errors on the console when they do not.

    (1.3.3) Safe delete does not include undo, you will need to go to the
    trash folder and retrieve the file(s) manually. The files can be viewed
    by clicking the view button near the safe delete option in the preferences
    window. Files moved to the trash folder are prefixed with a 6 digit
    number. Lower numbers are older, and deleted (permanently) first when the
    trash size limit is reached.

    (1.3.2) New in 1.3.2 are sidebars for exif data display and a sort
    manager. Exif (ctrl + E) should be self explanatory. The Sort manager is a
    directory list that allows copying or moving the displayed image to that
    destination with one click of the button - very helpful when visually
    sorting many images into subdirectories. To edit, reorder, or remove items
    in the sort list, use the right click menu. The keyboard can also be used
    by moving the focus to the desired button, then pressing menu/ctrl+f10 key
    to display the popup menu, or shift+up/shift+down keys to change the
    button location in the list. Items can also be added to the list by
    dragging a directory onto the list.

  Code hackers:

    If you plan on making any major changes to the code that will be offered
    for inclusion to the main source, please contact me first - so that we
    can avoid duplication of effort. A good example is porting any part of
    GQview that uses deprecated widgets to GTK2 widgets, there are already
    several such patches floating around. This is especially true if the
    change is listed in the TODO!
                                             -John ( johne@verizon.net )

  Known bugs:

    see the TODO file.

======== Installation

  Compilation: ./configure ; make
  General install: make install
  Removal: make uninstall

    - To build an RPM binary:

         on RedHat 6.x, 7.x use 'rpm -tb gqview-x.x.x.tar.gz'.
         on RedHat 8 and 9 use 'rpmbuild -tb gqview-x.x.x.tar.gz'.
         on other rpm distros, it depends on which version of rpm is used, if
         the option fails with the rpm command, try rpmbuild.

      Where the resulting package is placed is distribution specific, for
      example in RedHat it is placed in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/{architecture}/

======== Editor command macros                               [section:editors]

 Any one of the following filename markers may be used:

    %f  Replaced with list of selected files, may occur once.
    %p  Command is run once for each selected file, may occur multiple times.
   none When neither %f or %p exist, list of files is appended to command.

 Use of the following to display output window for the command:

    %v  Display result of command in output window, must occur as first two
        characters in the command, or immediately after the "%w" macro.
    %V  Like v above, but when used with %p, only displays output window for
        multiple files. The output of a single file is suppressed.

 Additional macros:

    %w  Prevent full screen from deactivating when command is executed,
        must occur as the first two characters.

======== Additional comments:

  Advanced options:
    These options are not adjustable in the preferences window, to change
    them edit $(HOME)/.gqview/gqviewrc while GQview is not running. An option
    becomes 'advanced' when it is removed from the user's visibility, and
    only remains so that those few users that really want it will not complain
    about it's removal :)

  lazy_image_sync: false
    Set true to enable the old behavior of lazy image updates when changing
    directories. (viewed image will remain until a new file is selected)

  display_dialogs_under_mouse: false
    Set true to force dialogs to display under the current mouse position,
    note that this goes against the preference set for the window manager.

======== Translation status:

 (as of 2.1.5)

   Please send po files/patches in gzipped form to ensure data integrity.

   Note: completion % in the chart below may not be quite correct when fuzzy
         translations exist but do not appear in the source.
         comp % = trans / (trans + fuzzy + untrans)
