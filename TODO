TODO key: d = done, w = work in progress, ? = possibly fixed
          * = required before next release

Major:
----------------------------------------------

d> figure out if crash when expanding a folder in the folder tree view when pessing "*" is a bug in
   GTK+ 2.10.4 (gdb shows it deep inside gtk). This does not happen on GTK+ 2.6.
   (determined fault of GTK+, filed as GTK+ bug #366782.

 > pixbuf-renderer.c:
   > tile dispose order is slightly incorrect, furthest ones from current position should be dropped first

 > image.c:
  d> test and probably fix delay_flip.
      > UPDATE: works as before (pre pixbuf-renderer), but should be fixed to provide a single redraw
        by pre-rendering any scaled tiles that are visible before signaling 'render_complete'.
   > make this a g_object with signals for completed, changed, etc.
   > fix delay flip 'completed' signal (full screen busy cursor is not always turned off)

 > cache-load.c:
   > should honor enable_thumbnails setting

 > color profiles:
  d> support profiles embedded in images
  d> check if clamp arg is handled correct in post_process_*()
   > add support in img-view.c

 >raw + exif formats:

   > all thats left to do is possibly mmap the file so we have all the tiff data available when
     looking for the make TIFF tag (0x10f) as it may not always fit within data available from
     the first read() in image-load.c.

   > support konica / minolta MakerNote, investigate RAW.

   > exif.c parser should not be using EXIF tags during tiff directory search for EXIF tag.

   > fix parsers to properly indicate which offsets are valid
     instead of making one zero if the other is found, this leads to making
     the file loader parse an entire file even if we found no jpeg but did find an exif segment.
     (simply set non-found offsets to file length?)

 > work on pan view:
   > Pick a better keyboard shortcut than Control + J :)
  w> Fix search scrolling to try to center image and info popup.
   > Fix info popup location to opposing horizontal side when near edge of grid.
   > Find something to do with middle mouse clicks.
   > should delete key actually work?
   > search should highlight all matching images (with toggle?)
   > should non-thumbnail images have a drop shadow?
  d> optimize pixbuf_draw_line (line endpoints should clip to draw region before draw loop)
     > introduced bug (looks like clamp or rounding error)
  d> optimize pixbuf_draw_triangle
     > introduced bug (round error?)
   > check ref counting of image when redrawing after finish loading

   > add control to toggle 'ignore folder symlinks'
   > the folder tree should not have to be re-read when changing options
     that do not effect the file list count/contents

   > time line view:
    w> allow use of file date or EXIF (embedded) date.
     > allow horizontal _or_ vertical orientation.

   > calendar view:
    w> fix search. (UPDATE: still can not find day containing name/path/partial)
     > supports thumbnail size images only, should grey out actual size items in size menu or something...
    w> allow use of file date or EXIF (embedded) date.
    d> fix scrolling when 'day' popup appears outsize of canvas.

   > grid view:
     > allow sorting by name, date, size, dimensions, etc.

   > flower view:
    d> do not show empty folders

   > under consideration:
     > split view

 > the info dialog is not set as a transient of the calling window, this causes it to be behind
   a full screen window when 'stay above other windows' is enabled.

 > folder tree view shortcuts for expanding/collapsing leak through to the main
   window (+,-,*,/, etc.), figure what behavior is desired and fix this.

 -------------

 > update translations:

 > document recent additions/changes:
   > Added 'Fast jpeg thumbnailing'.
   > xvpics is now hidden option.
   > Holding down shift will now scroll more when panning with mouse.
   > add --geometry command line option
   > add [shift]+G grayscale alteration
   > add F11 for full screen toggle
   > default edit commands not described.
   > add formatted rename option.
   > [Control]+V now shows image in new window
   > [Shift]+P print shortcut added to collection and img-view windows.
     (fixme, forgot to add it to find dialog).
   > add color profile page

   > add blurb about moving images between collections with shift+drag

   > start documenting the pan view, at least the basic options
     and how search works/what's supported


Minor (non blockers):
----------------------------------------------

d> fix memory leak in real_slideshow_start() when slideshow_step fails.

d> fix gtk_table_attach use to not use FALSE for fill vertical arg.

 > xv and xpaint are hardly used or even installed by any distro anymore - time
   to remove these (and find alternates?) seems silly to only have gimp.

 > allow editor commands to be interrupted (via SIGTERM?)
 > fix hanging editor commands that await user input (how to handle, or even detect this?)

 > when resizing/refreshing collection window, keep the same top left thumbnail visible

 > do not lose slideshow when reworking window layout.

d> fix printing of transparent images to not use black for transparency (white or user settable).

 > fix comment field in keywords bar to a height of 2 or 3 text lines.

 > add toolbar to: (UPDATE: these toolbars may not make it into 1.6)
   > find dupes window (with button to open dialog to add new files/folders)
   > collection window
   > search window

 > make wallpaper setting have a dialog to allow choosing tile, scale, center and then
   also choose desktop environment (or detect it somehow?)

Wishlist?:
----------------------------------------------

 > Explore tabbed view option to main window, where 'view in new window' option results
   in a new tab instead of window.

 > Initiating full screen from the command line should not
   show main window until full screen is exited.

 > Add shortcut to jump to next folder within parent folder.

 > add animated image support

 > add gamma correction patch

 > deleting a file should not discontinue slide show.

 > add option to only preload max # of thumbnails (to conserve memory),
   then release old/load new needed thumbnails on demand.

 > printing (low priority):
   > fix text postscript output by converting utf8 to a locale (better) understood by postscript...
   > allow selection of background color... (for image files only?)...
   > allow text color and font selection

 > image comparison window (displays two or more images for comparison)

 > add symlink option (in addition to the move/copy stuff.)

 > allow slideshow transition effects (wipe/fade etc.)

 > allow on the fly slideshow delay change with [,] and [.] (< and > too?)
   > show change in overlay for image...
   > account for changing of imd when toggling full screen...
   > should change be only to current slideshow?
